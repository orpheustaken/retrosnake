## Gameplay
This is a minor project, only the arrow keys are necessary to play the game, although it is possible to control the snake with WASD and HJKL (vim key bindings).

Simple sound effects were added and also score/record local storage. More complex features are still to be commited.

## Artwork
Its logo was designed on Inkscape and inspired by the retro and pixelated style of the old arcades.
