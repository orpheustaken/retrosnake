## Gameplay
This is a minor project, only the arrow keys are necessary to play the game, but it is also possible to control the snake with WASD and HJKL (vim key bindings).

A demo of the game is available to watch [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFV9VlCKn4Q).

## Artwork
Its logo was designed on Inkscape and inspired by the retro and pixelated style of the old arcades. The background photo was taken by [Ben Neale](https://unsplash.com/@ben_neale?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText), and can be found on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/photos/zpxKdH_xNSI).

Arcade sound effects are also present to increase the feeling of nostalgia and bring back those memories of simpler times.

## Settings
Dynamic settings were recently implemented and can now be changed from local storage:

* Snake Velocity
* Extension Rate
* Sound Volume

## Pseudo-Cryptography
Although the record is stored locally, a pseudo implementation of cryptography and randomly generated hash were added to prevent cheating.
